## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset (`dataset_banco.csv`) related to banking client information. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis or predictive modeling to identify potentially powerful (valuable) clients.

## 📁 Files

- `dataset_banco.csv`: Original raw dataset.
- `cleaned_dataset_banco.csv`: Final cleaned version of the dataset (generated by the script).
- `clean_data.py`: Python script used for the data cleaning process (based on this code).

## 📊 Cleaning Steps Performed

### ✅ Initial Checks
- Loaded the dataset and printed initial shape.
- Dropped rows with missing values.

### 🧠 Categorical Features
- Analyzed the number of unique values in categorical columns:
  - `job`, `marital`, `education`, `default`, `housing`, `loan`, `contact`, `month`, `poutcome`, `y`

### 📈 Numeric Features
- Checked standard deviation for numeric features to find non-varying columns:
  - `age`, `balance`, `day`, `duration`, `campaign`, `pdays`, `previous`
- Removed columns with 0 standard deviation (none were found in this case).

### 🧹 Data Deduplication
- Removed duplicate rows.

### 📦 Outlier Detection & Removal
- Boxenplots created for numeric features to visually identify outliers.
- Based on domain knowledge, removed:
  - Rows where `age > 100`
  - Rows where `duration <= 0`
  - Rows where `previous >= 100`

### 📊 Categorical Distribution
- Created count plots for each categorical variable to inspect class imbalance or anomalies.

### 🔥 Correlation Analysis
- Plotted a heatmap of the correlation matrix for numeric features.

### 💾 Save Cleaned Data
- Exported the cleaned dataset to `cleaned_dataset_banco.csv`.

## 📚 Dependencies
